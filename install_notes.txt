##To download, simply git clone with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/JLBLine/PUMA.git

##Once downloaded, add these two lines to your bashrc to find PUMA scipts:

export PUMA_DIR=*path-to-you-PUMA-directory*
export PATH=$PUMA_DIR/scripts:$PATH

##You'll also need to install stilts somewhere, and add it to the $PATH so PUMA can find it. See the README for information on stilts

##The example bash scripts in $PUMA_DIR/examples use the $PUMA_DIR variable, so
they will work out of the box if you follow the above, as well as heading to
$PUMA_DIR/original_cats, and unpacking the catalogues:

tar -vxjf vlssr_names.fits.tar.bz2
tar -vxjf vizier_mwacs.fits.tar.bz2
tar -vxjf vizier_mrc.fits.tar.bz2
tar -vxjf sumss_names.fits.tar.bz2
tar -vxjf vizier_nvss.fits.tar.bz2

Once this is done, typing 'source timing.sh' at the terminal will run PUMA to match 
MWACS to VLSSr, MRC, SUMSS and NVSS. After this, running 'source plot_outcomes.sh' in 
the same directory will plot some of the outcomes. Unfortunately, I haven't yet written 
documentation on plot_outcomes.py, but if you run plot_outcomes.py --help, the options 
will be summarised (there are quite a few!).
